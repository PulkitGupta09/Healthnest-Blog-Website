Running is an appealing exercise because it doesn&#39;t cost a lot to take part and you can run at any time that suits you.<\/p>\r\n<p>Some runners choose to participate in fun runs, athletics races or marathons. If you are interested in competing with other runners, contact your local running club.<\/p>\r\n<h2>Health benefits of running and jogging<\/h2>\r\n<p>Regular running or jogging offers many health benefits. Running can:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n   <li>help to build strong bones, as it is a weight bearing exercise<\/li>\r\n   <li>strengthen muscles<\/li>\r\n   <li>improve cardiovascular fitness<\/li>\r\n   <li>burn plenty of&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au\/health\/healthyliving\/kilojoules-and-calories\">kilojoules<\/a><\/li>\r\n   <li>help maintain a&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au\/healthyliving\/weight-management\">healthy weight<\/a>.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>An inactive lifestyle is associated with higher mortality, coronary artery disease,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au\/health\/conditionsandtreatments\/blood-pressure-high-hypertension\">hypertension<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au\/conditionsandtreatments\/stroke\">stroke<\/a>. It is also a primary cause of most chronic diseases, as the body rapidly adapts to insufficient physical activity which results in substantially reduced quality of life.<\/p>\r\n<p>Regular physical activity such as running can significantly improve&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au\/healthyliving\/healthy-mind\">mental health<\/a>, self-confidence, healthy ageing, and quality of life.<\/p>\r\n<h2>Running versus jogging<\/h2>\r\n<p>The difference between running and jogging is intensity. Running is faster, uses more kilojoules and demands more effort from the heart, lungs and muscles than jogging. Running requires a higher level of overall fitness than jogging.<\/p>\r\n<p>Both running and jogging are forms of aerobic exercise. Aerobic means &#39;with oxygen&#39; &ndash; the term &#39;aerobic exercise&#39; means any physical activity that produces energy by combining oxygen with blood glucose or body fat.<\/p>\r\n<h2>Goal setting for running and jogging<\/h2>\r\n<p>Think about what you want to achieve from running or jogging. Issues to consider may include:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n   <li><strong>Getting fit<\/strong>&nbsp;&ndash; if you&#39;re a beginner, you should start with&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au\/health\/healthyliving\/walking-for-good-health\">brisk walking<\/a>, progress to jogging and work up to running. This should take a few months.<\/li>\r\n   <li><strong>General fitness<\/strong>&nbsp;&ndash; mix your running with other forms of exercise (such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au\/health\/healthyliving\/swimming-health-benefits\">swimming<\/a>&nbsp;or team sports) to maximise your overall fitness.<\/li>\r\n   <li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au\/health\/healthyliving\/weight-loss-a-healthy-approach\">Weight loss<\/a>&nbsp;&ndash; adjust your diet to include plenty of fresh&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au\/health\/healthyliving\/fruit-and-vegetables\">fruits and vegetables<\/a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au\/health\/healthyliving\/Meat-and-poultry\">lean meats<\/a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au\/health\/healthyliving\/cereals-and-wholegrain-foods\">wholegrain cereals<\/a>&nbsp;and low-fat&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au\/health\/healthyliving\/Dairy-and-dairy-alternatives\">dairy products<\/a>.
